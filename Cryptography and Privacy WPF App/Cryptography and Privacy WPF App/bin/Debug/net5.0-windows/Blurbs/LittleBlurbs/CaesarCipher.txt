The Caesar cipher is yet another simple monoalphabetic shift cipher. With the Caesar shift cipher, each letter is "shifted" a certain number of places in the alphabet (with anything going over the max number of letters wrapping around). This simple yet widely used method derives its name from Julius Caesar, who used this cipher in order to protect sensitive communications in the days of the Roman Empire.
