The ADFGVX cipher was a manually applied cipher used by the German Army in WWI. This was a fractioning transposition cipher which combined a polybius square (think vigenere cipher) and a single columnar transposition, resulting in the only possible values of the ciphertext being A, D, F, G, V, or X. 

Initially considered to be unbreakable, the French cracking of the cipher in June 1918, and subsequent discovery of this by the Germans in the years following the war led to a desire for stronger cryptographic algorithms by the Germans. This eventually led to the creation of the Enigma machine.
