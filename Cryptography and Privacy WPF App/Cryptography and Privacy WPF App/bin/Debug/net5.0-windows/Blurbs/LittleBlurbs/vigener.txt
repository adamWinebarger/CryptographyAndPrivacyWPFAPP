The Vigenere cipher is a method of encrypting alphabetic text by using interwoven caesar ciphers based on the letters of a keyword. While this cipher is fairly easy to understand and implement, it was largely seen as unbreakable until 1863 (for reference, the first documented use of the cipher was 1553). This earned it the nickname "le chiffrage indechiffrable", which is French for 'the indecipherable cipher'.
