Encryption is a means of scramblind data so that only authorize parties can understand the information. In technical terms, it is the process of converting human-readable language into something resembling incomprehensible text - known as ciphertext - that can typically only be decrypted using a cryptographic key. 

While the ciphertext may appear sporadic and nonsenseical, the process of encryption is done in a very logical, predictable way. That way, the integrity of the data is preserved when decrypted using the proper key. While this may not be a widely talked about concept, encryption has been around at least since the days of the ancient Greeks and has played a crucial role in many historical events. These events are covered in greater detail in other parts of this program.
