While the evidence suggests that cryptography has existed in some form since ~1900BC, the Greek use of Scytale is often attributed as being one of the first major uses of cryptography. The scytale was a tool used by the ancient Greeks to perform transposition ciphers.

The use of Scytale involved wrapping a strip of parchment arould a wooden rod/cylinder in order to transpose a message. In order for this to work, the rods had to be cut to certain specs as not just any would do.

This means of encryption is one of of the earliest known uses of cryptography, and proved an effective way of generating secure messages for Greek field commanders during military campaigns.
