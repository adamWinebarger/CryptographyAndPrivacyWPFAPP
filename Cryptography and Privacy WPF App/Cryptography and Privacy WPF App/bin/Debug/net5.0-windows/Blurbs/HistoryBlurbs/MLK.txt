In the past, I often likened strong encryption to hotel cable: something that's nice to have, but not really necessary. In addition, the powers that be often view it as something used only by people to hide: criminals, terrorists, bad guys in general. The problem there lies in the fact that the powers that be often have trouble distinguishing between actual bad guys and people who are simply challenging the status quo. Martin Luther King Jr. makes for a surprisingly good example of that. 

Given his noteriety and challenge of the establishment in the early 1960's, the federal government felt the need to wiretap King's home. Worse yet, it seems like the act of wiretapping the King residence was done for little more reason than to gain dirt on the man in an attempt to discredit him; and even worse than that, any innappropriate stories or jokes told over open communication lines were recorded and sent to his wife, any organizations considering giving him an award, and pretty much anyone who would listen. While it's not surprising to think that the American government would act unethically, it is kind of wild that they would act this petty - especially towards a guy who simply said black people deserve the same rights as white people.

It also seems that these tactics haven't changed all that much as BLM protesters in the wake of George Floyd's murder were arrested as they were able to determine said protestors were at protests based on their mobile devices connecting to wifi networks in local shops. Meanwhile, you can give the police a video from a ring camera and tell them you know who stole your packages and they'll say there's nothing they can do... this is getting a little rambly. But just remember kids, the government is not your friend, and there is nothing wrong with wanting security and privacy for your communications no matter the reason.
