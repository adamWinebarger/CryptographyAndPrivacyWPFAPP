During the Napoleonic era, perhaps the biggest advancements made in the world of cryptography were the lessons in how not to do things. Because of the importance of information on a battlefield, many commanders, countries, etc. recognize the need for such information to be secure in order to prevent comprimise if intercepted. This idea, however, was apparently lost on Napoleon during the early days of the era that bears his name. This became particularly apparent in 1808 when a letter from Napoleon to the King of Spain was intercepted in the Iberian penninsula, written entirely in plaintext.

As is the case with many military leaders, Napoleon's reaction was a knee-jerk one. He tasked military leaders with creating a grand encryption methodology from the ground up in order to make all secure traffic hidden under an unbreakable cipher. From this, the French Army created the Army of Portugal Code: a massively complex cipher of roughly 150 numbers - each one representing a single letter or word. This, the French thought, would be an unbreakable cipher that would revolutionize the world of cryptography... and a British Army officer cracked it in a little over 48 hours. 

Apparently, having learned nothing from the past failure, Napoleon decided that the next cipher the French Army produced needed to be bigger and even more commplex. This one time, the cipher consisted of 1400 numbers with each number representing a letter, a word, a syllable, or simply being a junk character; and the incorporation of that last thing made conventional decryption methods like frequency analysis considerably less effective. 

Even with all of the added complexity, the same British Army officer who had cracked the Army of Portugal Cipher was able to crack this code in a year's time. This was due in large part to error on the side of the French Army, who, due to the time-consuming nature of encrypting using this cipher, would often only encrypt part of a message. Because of this, British Army officer Scott Sovell was able to parse the meanings of various encrypted values over time simply by seeing what was unencrypted in the surrounding context. So it just goes to show, if you have a secure means of encryption, either use it for the entire message or for none of it at all.
