In 1854, the Crimean War was in full swing. On one side was Russia; and on the other, France, Britain, The Ottoman Empire, and a few others. After years of tensions building over the treatment of Christians in Palestine, the war finally kicked off in 1853... frankly, the details aren't really that important. 

At this point in time, variations of the Vigenere cipher were still pretty commonplace for sending secure messages between military leaders on both sides. Of course, when the stakes are high, battlefield information is like gold, and the Vigenere cipher was largely thought to be unbreakable at this point. Seems like a pretty good way to keep your military communications secure, right?

Wrong. Enter Charles Babbage: inventor if the first mechanical computer (the Babbage Difference Engine), and apparently, quite the cryptographer. While a single word can typically be encrypted a number of ways using vigenere, Babbage noticed that the number of ways was equal to the number of letters in a keyword. From there, he was able to deduce that common occurences of the same combination of letters hinted at the length of the keyword. In determining the length of the keyword, Babbage was able to find a way to effectively crack the Vigenere cipher and give his side an advantage during the war. While this was a fairly minor advanted - it was basically Russia vs. all the rest of Europe after all - I still think it was pretty interesting. Also, Russia's ill feelings towards us in the years after the Crimean War was one of the main reasons we came to own Alaska, as the Russian's didn't want to do business with any other European powers at that point.
