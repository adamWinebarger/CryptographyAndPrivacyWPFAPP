While the exact origins of encryption are unknown, the earliest known cases of encryption originate in ancient Egypt. One of the more prominent beliefs on how it got its start was a desire to make religious ceremonies appear prominent, secret, and formal to the casual observer. 

By the 5th century BC, encryption had become useful for a myriad of military applications. In the Greek province of Sparta, an encryption scheme known as Skytale had become very prominent in which a thin piece of papyrus was wrapped around a round staff. From there, the message would be unwrapped from the staff and unreadable to anyone without an identical staff. While simple by modern standards, this was quite a creative solution given the technology of the day.
