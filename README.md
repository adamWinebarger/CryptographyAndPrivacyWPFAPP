# CryptographyAndPrivacyWPFAPP

So I put an app shortcut in this but it might not work. 

If that's the case, then got to "Cryptography And Privacy\CryptographyAndPrivacyWPFAPP\Cryptography and Privacy WPF App\Cryptography and Privacy WPF App\bin\Debug\net5.0-windows\" and double click the file called "Application.exe". You can also right-click it and create a shortcut to put on your desktop if you'd like. Enjoy.
